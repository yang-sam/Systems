The words in the string are extracted from the string, sorted in alphabetical order (with lowercase letters being sorted before uppercase letters), and then printed in order.

This program implements a hash table to sort the words extracted from the string. The hash table has a size of 26, one spot for each alphabetical character. Words are inputted into the linked list in sorted order.
